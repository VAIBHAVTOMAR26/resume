# Resume

This repository hosts my resume.

## Direct Links

- View on GitHub (renders in the browser):
  - https://github.com/VAIBHAVTOMAR26/resume/blob/main/Vaibhav-resume.pdf
- Raw download link (best for sharing to download directly):
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VAIBHAVTOMAR26/resume/main/Vaibhav-resume.pdf
- GitHub Pages (friendly URL that redirects straight to the PDF):
  - https://vaibhavtomar26.github.io/resume/

If the Pages link does not work yet, enable GitHub Pages as described below.

## Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/VAIBHAVTOMAR26/resume
2. Click Settings → Pages (or Settings → Code and automation → Pages).
3. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: `main` and folder: `/ (root)`
4. Click Save. GitHub Pages will build your site. It may take 1–3 minutes for the URL to start working.

After enabled, your Pages URL will be:

- https://vaibhavtomar26.github.io/resume/  → automatically opens Vaibhav-resume.pdf

## Notes

- If you rename the PDF, also update `index.html` to point to the new filename.
- Keep the PDF at the repository root so the redirect works without changes.
